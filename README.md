# GO-game
This is a two-player board game popular in Asia. This game is said to be harder than chess. It has significantly more combinations of possible games than chess.
Computer first won against the world champions in Chess back in 90's. However, it was widely believed that no computer could beat a world champion in GO. In 2016, this belief was shattered when
AlphaGO, developed by Deepmind, beat the world champion in GO. Read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol.

AlphaGO's algorithm is mainly based on reinforcement learning and monte carlo tree search. In this project, I developed a simple 5*5 GO game.

You can play with a friend, computer easy mode, and computer hard mode, or you can just start a game between two computers (easy vs easy or easy vs hard or hard vs hard). Just run `host.py` and follow the prompts to set the player.

In the easy mode, the computer just places a stone randomly. I created the hard mode using the minimax algorithm; which can play pretty well (I was never able to beat the hard mode, but I suck at GO anyway :( )

Please give it a try! Let me know if you were able to beat the hard mode!

Enjoy!!!

# How to run the game

Run `host.py` and follow the prompts to set the type of players.

You can play with a friend, computer (easy/hard), or start a game between two instances of computer.
